    "Typical fertilizer grades are expressed as three numbers separated by dashes, representing the percentages by weight of the three primary macronutrients: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P2O5), and potassium (K2O). Some common fertilizer grades include:\n",
    "\n",
    "10-10-10: Balanced fertilizer with equal percentages of N, P, and K for general purpose use.\n",
    "\n",
    "15-15-15: Another balanced fertilizer commonly used to supply equal amounts of the major nutrients.\n",
    "\n",
    "11-52-0 (Monoammonium Phosphate): High in phosphorus, with some nitrogen, no potassium.\n",
    "\n",
    "18-46-0 (Diammonium Phosphate): High phosphorus and nitrogen.\n",
    "\n",
    "30-0-0 to 46-0-0 (Urea): High nitrogen fertilizers with no phosphorus or potassium.\n",

    "13-0-44 (Potassium Nitrate): Supplies potassium and nitrogen.\n",

    "# Detail grades\n",
    " **For the fertilizer grade 30-0-20**, which indicates 30% nitrogen (N), 0% phosphate (P2O5), and 20% potassium (K2O), the nitrogen fraction can come from different nitrogen forms such as ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-), and urea (CO(NH2)2).\n",
    "\n",
    "**For the fertilizer 11-52-0**, which is Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP), the nitrogen content is almost entirely in the form of ammonium (NH4+). It contains about 11% nitrogen, all as ammoniacal nitrogen (NH4+), with no nitrogen as nitrate (NO3−) or urea. The chemical formula is NH4H2PO4, indicating the nitrogen is from the ammonium ion. There is no urea nitrogen in this fertilizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The fertilizer 15-15-15** is a balanced NPK fertilizer containing equal proportions (15% each) of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P2O5), and potassium (K2O). Regarding the forms of nitrogen in 15-15-15 fertilizers, these typically contain a balanced mixture of ammonium nitrogen (NH4+) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3−), with urea nitrogen generally not a major component.\n",
