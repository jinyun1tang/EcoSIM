#
# The uncertainty in the global monthly mean is estimated using a
# a monte carlo technique that computes 200 globally-averaged time
# series, each time using a slightly different set of measurement
# records from the NOAA GML cooperative air sampling network.  The
# reported uncertainty is the mean of the standard deviations
# for each monthly mean using this technique.  Please see Conway et al.,
# 1994, JGR, vol. 99, no. D11. for a complete discussion.  Units are ppm.
#
# CO2 expressed as a mole fraction in dry air, micromol/mol, abbreviated as ppm
#
# NOTE: In general, the data presented for the last year are subject to change,
# depending on recalibration of the reference gas mixtures used, and other quality
# control procedures. Occasionally, earlier years may also be changed for the same
# reasons.  Usually these changes are minor.
