description: "Run every EcoSIM example case for a few simulated days in an isolated scratch mirror and report which ones fail. Use when asked to smoke-test, sanity-check, or regression-screen the example cases after a Fortran change, to verify a build still runs end to end, or to check example namelists for startup and early-timestep failures. Also use before opening a PR that touches f90src/."

# EcoSIM Example Smoke Run

## Use When

- A Fortran change under `f90src/` or `drivers/` needs a quick "does everything still run" check.
- You want to know which example cases break, before spending hours on a long simulation.
- You are screening example namelists after changing an input dataset or parameter file.

Do **not** use this to judge scientific correctness. See [Limits](#limits).

## What It Does

For each namelist under `examples/run_dir/*/`:

1. Stages it in a scratch mirror so committed outputs and restart pointers are never touched.
2. Forces a short run (`stop_option='ndays'`, `stop_n=DAYS`) from the case's own `start_date`.
3. Runs the model, capturing a per-case log.
4. Verifies exit code **and** that the run reached `nstep = DAYS x 24`.
5. Scans every history file for genuine NaN/Inf and implausible soil temperature.

## Workflow

Confirm the build is current first — a stale binary invalidates the whole exercise:

```bash
cmake --build build/<configuration> --parallel 8
```

Then run the smoke test from the repository root:

```bash
.agents/skills/ecosim-smoke-run/scripts/run_smoke.sh            # all cases, 10 days
.agents/skills/ecosim-smoke-run/scripts/run_smoke.sh -d 2       # faster screen
.agents/skills/ecosim-smoke-run/scripts/run_smoke.sh biocrust dryland   # subset
```

Options: `-d DAYS` (default 10), `-b BUILD_DIR` (default: newest under `build/`),
`-o WORKDIR` (default: a `mktemp -d`), `-t CPU_SECS` per-case cap (default 1800).

Exit status is 0 only if every case completed its days *and* the output scan is
clean. The script prints a `CASE / RC / NSTEP / RESULT` table, then the scan.

To re-scan existing output without re-running:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/ecosim-smoke-run/scripts/check_history.py <dir-with-h0-files>
```

Reference run: all 17 namelists across 13 case directories pass at 10 days in
roughly 45 s total on an arm64 Mac.

## Reading The Result

| Symptom | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `RC != 0` | crash or CPU cap hit — read the case log |
| `RC = 0` but `NSTEP` short | model stopped early without failing; treat as a failure |
| `FAIL` in the output scan | model produced NaN/Inf, or temperature left the plausible range |
| `(N all-fill vars)` | **not** a fault — plantless cases fill every PFT variable |
| `NOT CHECKED` lines | a variable's `_FillValue` is itself NaN, so it cannot be judged |

Benign log noise, not failures: `CHECK_VAR: variable ... is not on initial
dataset`, and `Do error checking on file` from reading a `finidat` restart.

## Limits

A short run exercises input reading, initialization, and the first `DAYS x 24`
timesteps. It says nothing about:

- **Scientific correctness.** Passing means "did not crash and produced finite
  numbers," nothing more. Report it that way.
- **Long-term behavior.** The run starts at each case's `start_date` with all
  spinup cycling skipped, and several cases start decades before their forcing
  period (biocrust and bare_soil at 1800, DaLake at 1930), so this is
  early-spinup behavior only.
- **Conservation.** C/N/P, water, and energy balance drift needs a multi-year
  run or `regression-tests/` (`mtest`, `rtest`).

Never update a regression baseline on the strength of a passing smoke run.

## Implementation Notes

Read `references/pitfalls.md` before modifying either script. It records the
non-obvious failures that this procedure is built around — in particular why the
scratch mirror must use symlinks at matching depth, and why a NaN scan that
filters on magnitude silently reports every file as clean.
